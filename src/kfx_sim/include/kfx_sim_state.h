/** @file kfx_sim_state.h
 *     Header file for kfx_sim_state.c.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Holds struct Game's kfx_sim-owned field group, migrated out of
 *     game_legacy.h incrementally per docs/refactor/stage-05-god-headers.md's
 *     decision and docs/refactor/stage-06-kfx-sim.md's "Prerequisite from
 *     stage 5" section. Landing incrementally (see the stage 6.7 plan) --
 *     fields are added to this struct, and removed from struct Game, one
 *     cohesive group at a time. `struct Game` is raw-serialized wholesale
 *     (see src/net_resync.cpp, src/game_saves.c, src/main_game.c's
 *     clear_complete_game()); this struct grows the same way and those three
 *     call sites were updated once, in the first field group, to also cover
 *     it via sizeof(kfx_sim_state) -- no further changes needed there as
 *     later groups are added.
 * @par Comment:
 *     Just a header file - #defines, typedefs, function prototypes etc.
