// kfx_sim "player" cluster depth increment, per docs/refactor/testing/
// comprehensive/stage-08b-kfx-sim-clusters.md's "still open" list:
// player_utils.c's scoring/status functions. player_has_lost and
// player_cannot_win are both pure reads over player/dungeon/thing state
// already set up (no orchestration, no mutation) -- pattern A on
// kfx_sim_state, same fixture player_data_test.cpp/thing_data_test.cpp
// use. compute_player_final_score/take_money_from_dungeon_f and friends
// are NOT attempted here: they additionally reach through sim_feedback
// (a callback struct) and/or dungeon gold bookkeeping across many slabs,
// a bigger increment than this pass's two functions.
