// kfx_sim "creature" cluster, hard-tail depth increment: the first test
// for creature_states_hero.c. This file is almost entirely hero-AI
// wandering/attack-target-selection/tunnelling logic reaching into
// navigation and dungeon-heart-reachability checks (creature_can_get_to_dungeon_heart,
// find_nearest_room_of_role_for_thing_with_spare_capacity) -- genuinely
// the hard tail, left for a later increment. Two functions are tractable
// without any of that: check_out_hero_has_money_for_treasure_room's
// cheap early-return, and is_hero_tunnelling_to_attack, which resolves
// through get_players_special_digger_model's default (non-roaming,
// zeroed digger breed config) fallback chain -- traced by reading the
// body rather than assumed, since it routes through two
// ConfigReloadCallbacks members (get_player_special_digger,
// player_is_roaming) before falling back to the plain
// special_digger_good/_evil config fields.
