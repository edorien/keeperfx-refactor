// kfx_sim "creature" cluster, hard-tail depth increment: the first test
// for creature_states_prisn.c (previously untouched, per
// stage-08b's "13 other creature_states_*.c files remain completely
// untouched" note). jailbreak_possible is the one function in this file
// that isn't a process_state/cleanup_state entry point needing a full
// Room+job fixture -- it walks a real room->slabs_list chain (the same
// get_next_slab_number_in_room mechanism room_lair_test.cpp/
// tasks_list_test.cpp already exercise) and calls slab_by_players_land.
//
// slab_by_players_land's slab_is_safe_land call routes through
// get_slab_stats(), which (per slab_data_test.cpp/thing_doors_test.cpp's
// documented limitation) always resolves to slab_cfgstats[0] in this test
// binary regardless of the real slab -- so is_safe_land is set globally
// via slab_cfgstats[0], while slabmap_owner/slab_is_liquid (both reading
// slb->kind/slb->owner directly, no callback involved) reflect the real
// per-slab state set up here.
//
// The escaping player is tested as player 3, not 5: PLAYER_NEUTRAL is 5,
// and the fixture sets neutral_player_num to that same value (needed so
// room.owner==0 below doesn't itself collide with a zeroed
// neutral_player_num) -- an earlier draft used player 5 as the escaping
// creature's owner too and silently hit jailbreak_possible's own
// neutral-player early return, caught by a CAPTURE probe showing
// slab_by_players_land itself returning true while the wrapping function
// still returned false, before switching to player 3.
