// kfx_sim coverage: player_compevents.c's computer-AI "event" handlers
// are almost entirely built on computer_able_to_use_power (itself gated
// by is_power_available's config_reload_callbacks/dungeon_availability
// chain, whose defaults aren't simple enough to reason about without a
// dedicated fixture) and task-creation calls, so only the cheap early-out
// guard clauses are tractable here: computer_event_check_payday returns
// immediately once a dungeon already has enough gold for its pay bill,
// and computer_event_check_fighters returns immediately when there are no
// fights in progress at all -- both true of a freshly zeroed dungeon by
// construction (0 >= 0, 0 <= 0), so both are exercised without any
// fixture setup beyond ResetSimAndConfig.
//
// player_compevents.c is the last of kfx_sim/src's originally-header-less
// files (see player_compchecks_test.cpp's note) to get any coverage.
// Forward-declared locally since no header exists for this file.
//
// Deliberately deferred: everything past those guards in this file
// (computer_event_battle/_find_link/_attack_magic_foe/_check_rooms_full/
// _save_tortured/_rebuild_room/_handle_prisoner/_attack_door) -- all
// power-availability, task-queue, and creature-search heavy.
