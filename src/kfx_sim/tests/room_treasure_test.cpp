// kfx_sim "room" cluster depth increment, per docs/refactor/testing/
// comprehensive/stage-08b-kfx-sim-clusters.md's "still open" list:
// room_treasure.c's count_gold_slabs_* family, the same shape as
// room_data.c's count_slabs_*_wth_effcncy siblings already covered in
// room_capacity_test.cpp -- a pure function of room->slabs_count/efficiency
// -> room->total_capacity. get_wealth_size_types_count() (thing_objects.c)
// is a hidden dependency, but it's a compile-time constant (5, the length
// of gold_hoard_objects[]) with no state to fake -- confirmed by reading
// its body, not assumed. The rest of room_treasure.c
// (find_gold_hoarde_at/treasure_room_eats_gold_piles/
// count_gold_hoardes_in_room) needs a real map+thing-list fixture and is
// left for a later increment.
