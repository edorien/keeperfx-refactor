/** @file packet_data.c
 *     struct Packet's storage and trivial accessors -- see packet_data.h.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Moved down from kfx_net's packets.c/packets_misc.c/kfx_net_state.h
 *     (docs/refactor/todo/remove-symbol-level-layering-residuals.md):
 *     sim_packets[]/bad_packet and these four accessors never actually
 *     needed anything net-specific, just get_player() (kfx_sim) and
 *     bounds checks, so nothing about them justified kfx_sim/kfx_render
 *     reaching up into kfx_net to call them. kfx_net's own
 *     packets.c/packets_misc.c/net_exchange_gameplay.c keep writing into
 *     sim_packets[] directly for their own genuinely net-owned logic
 *     (checksums, wire buffer packing, turn-history exchange) -- that's a
 *     higher-ranked library writing into a lower-ranked library's state,
 *     which is fine; only the reverse (what this file replaces) was the
 *     violation.
 * @par Comment:
 *     None.
