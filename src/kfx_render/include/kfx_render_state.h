/** @file kfx_render_state.h
 *     Header file for kfx_render_state.c.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Holds struct Game's remaining kfx_render-owned fields, migrated out
 *     of game_legacy.h per docs/refactor/stage-13-enforce-and-document.md
 *     (mirrors kfx_sim_state.h/kfx_net_state.h/kfx_game_state.h/
 *     kfx_frontend_state.h's approach from stages 6.7/7.2/8.3/9.3). Unlike
 *     those four, kfx_render never got its own state struct during
 *     stage 7 -- these fields were simply missed. `struct Game` is
 *     raw-serialized wholesale (see kfx_net/src/net_resync.cpp,
 *     kfx_game/src/game_saves.c, kfx_game/src/main_game.c's
 *     clear_complete_game()); this struct is synced/saved/reset the same
 *     way, alongside the other four, at all three call sites.
 * @par Comment:
 *     Just a header file - #defines, typedefs, function prototypes etc.
