// §1.2: colored_stripey_lines[]'s stripey_line_color_array is TbPixel[16],
// but was initialized from 16 bare palette-index scalars -- valid while
// TbPixel was one byte, silently wrong (C++ brace elision only fills the
// first ~4 of 16 slots, the rest staying zero-initialized/transparent
// black) once TbPixel widened to a 4-byte struct. -Wmissing-braces didn't
// catch this nested-inside-a-struct-initializer case (it did catch the
// flatter net_player_colours[] instance elsewhere), so this test exists as
// the compiler-independent check.
