/** @file game_campaign_progress.h
 *     Header file for game_campaign_progress.c.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Phase A of docs/refactor/gui/05-campaign-progress-and-landview.md --
 *     save/progress.cfg, a per-campaign progress record (which levels are
 *     unlocked, plus everything the old fx1contn.sav's IntralevelData held)
 *     for every campaign the player has ever played, not just one "active"
 *     campaign. Used only by the new (non-`-classicmenu`) menu -- see
 *     the design doc's §3.4 for why `-classicmenu` keeps its own,
 *     completely separate fx1contn.sav path untouched.
 * @par Comment:
 *     Just a header file - #defines, typedefs, function prototypes etc.
