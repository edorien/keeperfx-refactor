/** @file kfx_game_state.h
 *     Header file for kfx_game_state.c.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Holds struct Game's kfx_game-owned field group, migrated out of
 *     game_legacy.h per docs/refactor/stage-09-kfx-game.md (mirrors
 *     stage 6.7/7.2/8.3's kfx_sim_state.h/kfx_net_state.h approach).
 *     `struct Game` is raw-serialized wholesale (see src/net_resync.cpp,
 *     src/game_saves.c, src/main_game.c's clear_complete_game()); this
 *     struct is synced the same way, alongside kfx_sim_state/
 *     kfx_net_state, at all three call sites.
 * @par Comment:
 *     Just a header file - #defines, typedefs, function prototypes etc.
