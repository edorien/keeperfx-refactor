/**
 * @file ftest_packet_capture.h
 * @brief Records the local player's per-turn command packet during a
 * functional test, and asserts against it.
 *
 * KeeperFX multiplayer is lockstep: every client re-simulates the world
 * from the same per-turn input packets (packets_input.c). So the
 * determinism boundary for any GUI change is the `struct Packet` the GUI
 * produces -- if a migrated (ImGui) menu sets the same action/parameters
 * on the same game turn as the legacy sprite menu, every client stays in
 * sync. This harness captures that packet and provides golden-trace and
 * single-action assertions over it.
 *
 * Capture point: gameplay_loop_logic() calls ftest_packet_capture_tick()
 * once per game turn, immediately after exchange_packets() has finalized
 * the local packet and before update()/process_packets() clears it -- the
 * same packet that goes on the wire in a real MP game.
 *
 * A test action sets its packet from ftest_update(), which runs earlier
 * in the same gameplay_loop_logic() call than input()/exchange_packets().
 * front_input.c's per-view input paths gate on
 * "get_players_packet_action(player) != PckA_None" -- an already-queued
 * action is respected, not overwritten -- so the injected action still
 * stands at the capture point. If that ever stops holding, move the tick
 * call to right after ftest_update() instead.
 *
 * See docs/refactor/ingame-gui/06-tab-content-panels.md section 4 and
 * docs/refactor/ingame-gui/01-seam-and-toggle.md.
