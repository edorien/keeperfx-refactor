/** @file kfx_net_state.h
 *     Header file for kfx_net_state.c.
 * @par Purpose:
 *     Holds struct Game's kfx_net-owned field group, migrated out of
 *     game_legacy.h per docs/refactor/stage-08-kfx-net.md (mirrors
 *     stage 6.7/7.2's kfx_sim_state.h approach). `struct Game` is
 *     raw-serialized wholesale (see src/net_resync.cpp, src/game_saves.c,
 *     src/main_game.c's clear_complete_game()); this struct is synced the
 *     same way, alongside kfx_sim_state, at all three call sites.
 * @par Comment:
 *     Just a header file - #defines, typedefs, function prototypes etc.
