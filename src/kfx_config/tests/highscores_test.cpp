// kfx_config: highscores.c's add_high_score_entry()/get_level_highest_score()
// -- a genuinely nontrivial sorted-array insertion algorithm (find
// insert position by score, separately find a duplicate-level slot to
// overwrite, shift the gap between them) operating purely on the
// module-level `campaign` global's hiscore_table/hiscore_count (already
// exposed for tests via config_campaigns_test.cpp's own
// ResetGlobalCampaign pattern). load_high_score_table()/
// create_empty_high_score_table()/save_high_score_table() all touch
// real file I/O (prepare_file_path/LbFileLengthRnc/LbFileSaveAt) and
// are `static` besides -- not attempted here.
