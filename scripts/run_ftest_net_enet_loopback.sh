# Runs the Phase 2 real-ENet-loopback ftest pair
# (docs/refactor/todo/ftest-fake-multiplayer.md) -- net_enet_loopback_host
# and net_enet_loopback_join -- as two separate keeperfx processes talking
# over real 127.0.0.1 UDP. Exists because these two tests are only halves
# of one session: neither can pass run alone (see src/ftests/ftest_list.c's
# comment on why they live in long_running_tests_list, and each test file's
# own header comment).
#
# If keeperfx-dir is a KFX_TEST_COVERAGE build (detected via the presence of
# any .gcno file), this also merges the two processes' gcov data into that
# tree's coverage.info/coverage-html -- see "Coverage merge" below -- and,
# if out/coverage (the unit-test tree) already has its own coverage.info,
# refreshes the combined out/coverage-merged report the same way
# scripts/merge_coverage.sh does. Both are best-effort: a non-coverage build
# just runs the tests, and a missing unit-test coverage.info only skips the
# final combined-report step, neither is a hard failure.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/run_ftest_net_enet_loopback.sh [keeperfx-dir]
#
# keeperfx-dir defaults to out/coverage-ftest (a KFX_FUNCTESTING build tree
# with staged game data -- see src/ftests/README.md). Must contain a built
# `keeperfx` binary and its staged fxdata/campgns/levels/etc.
#
# Known limitation (see the plan doc's "Phase 2 port allocation" note):
# FTEST_NET_ENET_LOOPBACK_PORT (src/ftests/tests/ftest_net_enet_loopback_shared.h)
# is a fixed port, not dynamically allocated -- a collision with something
# else already bound to it locally will make this fail in a way that looks
# like a real bug.
