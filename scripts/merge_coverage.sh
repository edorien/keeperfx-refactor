# Merges the two independent coverage.info files this repo can produce --
# the Catch2 unit-test harness's (KFX_BUILD_TESTS+KFX_TEST_COVERAGE) and
# src/ftests/'s in-game functional-test harness's
# (KFX_FUNCTESTING+KFX_TEST_COVERAGE) -- into one combined lcov report.
# They're generated from separate build trees (the two options are
# mutually exclusive in a single configure -- see CMakeLists.txt's
# KFX_FUNCTESTING option, or docs/Architecture/testing-harness.md §7.1),
# so combining them is a post-hoc lcov step, not a CMake target: lcov
# --add-tracefile merges LF/LH/FNF/FNH per source line across the two
# inputs, so a line either suite hits counts as hit in the merged report.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/merge_coverage.sh [unit-test-tree] [ftest-tree] [output-dir]
#
# Defaults match docs/Architecture/testing-harness.md's own conventions:
#   unit-test-tree: out/coverage       (KFX_BUILD_TESTS+KFX_TEST_COVERAGE)
#   ftest-tree:     out/coverage-ftest (KFX_FUNCTESTING+KFX_TEST_COVERAGE)
#   output-dir:     out/coverage-merged
#
# Each tree must already have a coverage.info in it -- i.e. you've already
# run `cmake --build <tree> --target coverage` in both. This script only
# combines already-generated reports; it doesn't build or run anything.
