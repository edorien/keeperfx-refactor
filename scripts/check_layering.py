"""Dependency-layering checker for the KeeperFX src/kfx_*/ split.

Stage 13 of docs/refactor/: a mandatory, CI-blocking check that turns
"does library X depend on library Y the wrong way round" into something
the build can answer, instead of something read out of hundreds of files
by eye.

By this stage every file has a real src/<name>/{src,include} home (see
docs/refactor/stage-13-enforce-and-document.md), so classification is just
"which src/<name>/ directory is this file under" -- the physical layout
*is* the CMake target membership, since every src/<name>/CMakeLists.txt
globs its own src/*.c|*.cpp into exactly one OBJECT library (see e.g.
src/kfx_platform/CMakeLists.txt). No hand-maintained per-file table to
keep in sync with the code anymore. Every kfx_* library lives directly
under src/ (unified there after the SDL3 merge, not a separate top-level
libs/ tree), alongside main.cpp/ftests/.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_layering.py            # human-readable report
    python3 scripts/check_layering.py --json      # machine-readable report
    python3 scripts/check_layering.py --strict    # exit 1 on any violation

Exit code is always 0 unless --strict is passed. CI passes --strict (see
.github/workflows/*.yml) so a back-edge fails the build, not just a
code-review nitpick.

# Library order, lowest (fewest allowed dependencies) to highest.
# An edge "A includes B" is only valid if RANK[lib(B)] <= RANK[lib(A)].
# kfx_script, kfx_apploop, and app_entry are allowed to depend on anything
# (see docs/refactor/stage-11-kfx-script.md and
# stage-12-slim-app-target.md) so they're ranked above everything else;
# nothing should depend on *them*, which the checker will also flag if it
# happens. kfx_apploop (stage 12.5) holds the top-level game/frontend
# session loop (game_loop/wait_at_frontend/keeper_gameplay_loop/update()
# and the frame-pacing helpers around them) -- by design it ties every
# other layer together each frame, so forcing it through per-call
# callback injection (the pattern every other "layer X needs layer Y"
# case in this refactor uses) would mean adding on the order of 40 new
# GameCallbacks/RenderOverlayCallbacks entries for what is genuinely the
# app's main loop, not domain logic. It's its own top-ranked library
# instead, kept out of the app target (stage 12's exit criterion).
#
# This list is also the authoritative "which physical directory maps to
# which library" answer -- each entry names a src/<entry>/ directory
# except app_entry, which has no src/<name>/ directory of its own (it's
# whatever's left directly under src/: main.cpp today).

# refactor (an ABI-shared struct, an intentional raw-blob wire format, or a
# single legitimate direct call). --strict does not fail on these; it
# fails on anything NOT in this list, so a genuinely new violation still
# blocks CI. Remove an entry here if a future change actually resolves it
# -- don't let this list grow to paper over new violations.
#
# Empty as of docs/refactor/todo/remove-remaining-layering-violations.md:
# both prior entries here (net_resync.cpp's kfx_frontend_state.h/
# kfx_game_state.h/game_legacy.h raw-blob resync includes, and
# bflib_enet.cpp's net_main.h include) turned out to be fixable once the
# ftest coverage built in docs/refactor/todo/ftest-fake-multiplayer.md
# made attempting the fix safe to verify. net_resync.cpp now exports/
# imports the upper-layer structs via NetCallbacks (same pattern the file
# already used for Lua's resync payload) instead of #include'ing them
# directly; bflib_enet.cpp's struct NetSP contract moved down to
# kfx_platform's bflib_netsp.h, the layer that actually implements it.
